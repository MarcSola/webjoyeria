				Trained at different schools and workshops in Barcelona and taking after his father, who also ejoyed fixing clocks and any other kind of machine or engine that was broken down, in the 80's Jaume Oliveras decided to start his own bussiness up in jewelry and clock reparation and restoration in Olesa de Montserrat.

				<br>
				<br>

				Throughout these last 35 years, as well as selling clocks, watches and jewelry from important brands, Jaume has devoted himself to the craftsmanship of his own pieces of jewelry. 

				<br>
				<br>
				
				Using gold and silver as raw material the artist's creativity is displayed in his personal style, with designs specially inspired by symbolic locations and things from his town, making every piece of jewelry become unique in its kind and conveying a special feeling to the person who wears it.
